# The Canyon Alliance Administrative Web Map

This project presents a public-facing version of the interactive 3D web map created to support emergency preparedness, planning, and coordination within the Santa Monica Mountains region following the 2025 Palisades Fire.

## Overview

As part of a GIS internship with The Canyon Alliance, this site was developed to enhance situational awareness and promote spatial collaboration among fire officials, emergency personnel, and community leaders. The map provides a detailed view of residential structures, parcel boundaries, and neighborhood zones.

This version excludes any personally identifiable data and mirrors the geometry and layout of the secure internal administrative map used by authorized Alliance members.

## Features

- 3D visualization of structures and property boundaries
- Built-in responsiveness for desktop and mobile use
- Scroll-based animations and clean section layout
- Secure iframe embedding of live map visualization

## Technologies Used

- **ArcGIS Pro** – For spatial data creation, symbology, and GeoJSON export  
- **MapLibre GL JS** – Browser rendering of 3D structures and styling  
- **Turf.js** – Client-side geometry calculations and filtering  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Custom interface and animations  
- **GeoJSON** – Format for spatial data interoperability  

## Purpose

The map is intended as a spatial tool to assist with:

- Emergency evacuation planning  
- Infrastructure coordination  
- Community outreach and education  
- Inter-agency visual alignment
